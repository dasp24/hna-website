            Ever fancied working with the likes of Helena Bonham Carter, Patrick Stewart, Tom Hardy, Robbie Coltrane, Dame Judy Dench, Christopher Eccleston or Sheridan Smith? Working with HNA Facilities, you can experience the magic of television and film production from behind the scenes, and get paid.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a leading supplier of location vehicles to the Film and TV industry, we are always looking to grow our on-location teams. Do you have what it takes?
            </p>
            <p>
            If you’ve got enthusiasm, extensive driving experience with large vehicles and trailers, a full clean licence, DCPC entitlement (or a Class I/ Class II licence) and a friendly, personal demeanour, we might be able to get you started right away.
            </p>

            <p>
            As the face of HNA, our drivers and team captains are expected to represent HNA in the most professional manner at all times. Once you’ve been trained up, your role will include staying with the trailers for 5 or 6 days a week for the duration of the shoot, adhering to the needs to production and liaising with different departments. But be warned, filming hours are long but gratifying.
            </p>
            <p>
            We operate from our Manchester headquarters to service productions throughout the UK and Europe. We also have regular requirements for shunting work up and down the country (evenings / nights and weekend vehicle moves on an ad hoc basis that do not require starting or ending in Manchester).
